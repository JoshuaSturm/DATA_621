# Introduction
Your objective is to build a binary logistic regression model on the training data set to predict whether the neighbourhood will be at risk for high crime levels. You will provide classifications and probabilities for the evaluation data set using your binary logistic regression model. You can only use the variables given to you (or, variables that you derive from the variables provided).

# 1. Data Exploration

## 1.1 Load Libraries
```{r load-libraries}
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
library(corrplot)
library(caret)
```

## 1.2 Read in data
```{r import-data, cache = T}
crime <- read.csv("crime-evaluation-data_modified.csv", stringsAsFactors = F)
crime.training <- read.csv("crime-training-data_modified.csv", stringsAsFactors = F)
```

### 1.2.1 Create data dictionary
```{r data-dictionary, cache = T}
defs <- c("proportion of residential land zoned for large lots (over 25000 square feet)",
          "proportion of non-retail business   acres per suburb", 
          "a dummy var. for whether the suburb borders the Charles River (1) or not (0)", 
          "nitrogen oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)", "average number of rooms per dwelling", 
          "proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940", 
          "weighted mean of distances to five Boston employment centers", 
          "index of accessibility to radial highways", "full-value property-tax rate per $10,000", 
          "pupil-teacher ratio by town", "lower status of the population (percent)", 
          "median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000s")

crime.dict <- data.frame(names(crime), defs, "Outcome variable", stringsAsFactors = F)
names(crime.dict) <- c("Variable Name", "Definition")
```

```{r print-dictionary, cache = T}
kable(crime.dict, format = "latex", booktabs = T) %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = c("striped", "scale_down"))
```

## 1.3 Basic dataset statistics
```{r describe, cache = T}
crime.desc <- psych::describe(crime.training)

kable(crime.desc, format = "latex", booktabs = T) %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = c("striped", "scale_down"))
```

The training data has `r dim(crime.training)[[1]]` cases, with `r dim(crime.training)[[2]]` predictor variables. Each case represents a neighbourhood in Boston. Our large sample size satisfies one of the requirements to fit our data to a logistic model.

```{r check-for-missing, eval = F, cache = T}
any(is.na(crime.training))
```

Amazingly, there is not a single `NA` in the entire dataset, which will make our data cleaning job much easier!

## 1.4 Summary Graphs

### 1.4.1 Boxplot
```{r summary-boxplot, cache = T}
crime.training.bp <- crime.training %>%
  select(-target) %>%
  gather()
summary.boxplot <- ggplot(crime.training.bp, aes(x = key, y = value)) +
  labs(x = "variable", title = "Crime Data Training Boxplot") +
  geom_boxplot(outlier.colour = "red", outlier.shape = 1)
summary.boxplot
```

Aside from `zn`, this dataset doesn't have too many outliers.

### 1.4.2 Histogram

```{r summary-histogram, cache = T}
crime.training.hist <- ggplot(data = crime.training.bp, mapping = aes(x = value)) + 
  geom_histogram(bins = 10) + 
  facet_wrap(~key, scales = 'free_x')
crime.training.hist
```

We can see some variables, `age`, `chas`, `rad`, `zn`, in particular, are strongly skewed.

### 1.4.3 Correlation 

#### 1.4.3.1 Correlation Heatmap

```{r summary-correlation-heatmap, cache = T}
crime.training.corr <- crime.training %>%
  #select(-target) %>%
  na.omit()
corrplot(cor(crime.training.corr), method = "color", type = "lower")
```

#### 1.4.3.2 Correlation (with response) table

```{r summary-correlation-table, cache = T}
# apply(crime.training[, -13], 2, cor.test, crime.training$target)

corp <- apply(crime.training[, -13], 2, function(x) cor.test(x, y=crime.training$target)$p.value)
cortable <- cor(crime.training[, -13], crime.training$target)
kable(cbind(as.character(corp), cortable), format = "latex", booktabs = T, col.names = c("P-value", "Correlation with response")) %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = c("striped"))
```

From the above correlation analysis, it appears that `chas` is not correlated with neither the response variable, nor any of the other predictor variables. This is important to note, since we may consider removing it from the final model.

Another concern is the high correlation between `rad` and `tax` - a staggering `r cor(crime.training$rad, crime.training$tax)`! We may want to remove one of these predictors from our model to prevent muddying it with collinearity.

# 2. Data Preparation

## 2.1 Missing Data
As noted earlier, the dataset is remarkably whole, so we may proceed without worrying about having to imputate any data.

## 2.2 Normality of Predictor Variables
As can be seen in the distribution plots in [section 1.4.2][1.4.2 Histogram], many of the predictor variables are not normally distributed. However, since logistic regression makes no assumptions, including the normality of the variables, we can safely skip this step, and keep the variables as they are.

## 2.3 Add or Remove Variables
As mentioned before, we'll consider removing two variables for one of our models. `chas`, due to it's low correlation with any of the other variables, and either `rad` or `tax`, due to high collinearity between the two.

Other than the variables mentioned above, I don't see any reason to remove any variables. Furthermore, there isn't enough implicit information from which we could possibly derive new variables.

## 2.4 Variable Transformation
`r sum(crime.training$zn == 0)` of `r NROW(crime.training$zn)` cases in the `zn` variable have a value of 0, or roughly `r round((sum(crime.training$zn == 0)/NROW(crime.training$zn))*100,2)`%. We may want to convert this to a binary variable, where 

\[ zn = 
\begin{cases} 
      0 & zn = 0 \\
      1 & zn \neq 0
\end{cases}
\]

Additionally, we'll convert both the `target` variable, as well as `chas`, from integers to factors.

```{r variable-transformation}
crime.training$chas <- as.factor(crime.training$chas)
crime.training$target <- as.factor(crime.training$target)
crime$chas <- as.factor(crime$chas)
```


## 2.5 Outliers
I believe that once we recode the variable `zn` as outlined in [section 2.4][2.4 Variable Transformation], we will no longer have the outlier issue that is currently affecting the predictor.

# 3. Build Models
Note that I will not be using any sort of 'automatic' model selection, e.g. stepwise regression. After reading [this article](https://www.stata.com/support/faqs/statistics/stepwise-regression-problems/), I've decided to forego any automated choosing, and build (and test) the models myself.

## 3.1 Model 1
My first model will use the original dataset as is, without any variable changes. This will serve as a sort of benchmark with which to gauge the effectiveness of our changes.

```{r model-one, cache = T}
model1 <- glm(formula = target ~ .,
              family = binomial(link = "logit"),
              data = crime.training)
summary(model1)
```

### 3.1.1 Model 1 Interpretation
There are several variables that are not significant to the model (i.e. $P > 0.05$), including `indus`, `chas`, `rm`, `lstat`, with `zn` right on the border of 0.05.

`zn`, `indus`, `rm`, and `tax` are all negatively correlated to the `target` variable, meaning an increase in any of these is correlated with a lower occurence of crime.

```{r mod-one-coeff, cache = T}
m1coef <- round(model1$coefficients[-1], 4)
m1e <- c("More large homes would indicate a wealthier neighbourhood (unless zn is referring to apartment buildings)", "More likely to be a suburban (rather than urban) neighbourhood", "I'm not familiar with the Boston area", "Higher pollution could be due to industry or a poorly-funded area, both of which attract crime", "More rooms means a larger home, which would mean a wealthier neighbourhood", "Older units are more likely to be occupied by lower-income residents, and lower-income neighbourhoods are more likely to have crime", "Neighbourhoods farther away from employment centers have higher crime, possibly due to unemployment", "Access to highways might indicate a more urban neighbourhood, which tend to have higher crime", "This one is unclear. Higher tax rate could be due to size of unit, or overall high tax rate for that area", "Higher ratio is more likely in poorly-funded districts, which tend to have higher crime", "Lower income neighbourhoods tend to have more crime", "Surprising that neighbourhoods with higher-valued homes had more crime")
kable(cbind(m1coef, m1e), format = "latex", booktabs = T, col.names = c("Coefficient", "Possible Reasoning")) %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = c("striped"), full_width = T) %>%
  column_spec(3, width = "30em")
```

The model has an AIC (Akaike information criterion) of `r round(model1$aic, 2)`, and a BIC (Bayesian information criterion) of `r round(BIC(model1), 2)`.

With a Null deviance of `r round(model1$null.deviance, 2)`, and a Residual deviance of `r round(model1$deviance, 2)`, we get a difference of `r round(model1$null.deviance - model1$deviance, 2)`.

Lastly, let's run an ANOVA Chi-Square test to view the effect each predictor variable is having on the response variable.

```{r model-one-anova}
anova(model1, test = "Chisq")
```

## 3.2 Model 2
For our second model, we'll remove the variables deemed insignificant in model 1.

```{r model-two, cache = T}
model2 <- glm(formula = target ~ . -indus -chas -rm -lstat,
              family = binomial(link = "logit"),
              data = crime.training)
summary(model2)
```

### 3.2.1 Model 2 Interpretation
```{r mod-two-coeff, cache = T}
m2coef <- round(model2$coefficients[-1], 4)
m2e <- c("More large homes would indicate a wealthier neighbourhood (unless zn is referring to apartment buildings)", "Higher pollution could be due to industry or a poorly-funded area, both of which attract crime", "Older units are more likely to be occupied by lower-income residents, and lower-income neighbourhoods are more likely to have crime", "Neighbourhoods farther away from employment centers have higher crime, possibly due to unemployment", "Access to highways might indicate a more urban neighbourhood, which tend to have higher crime", "This one is unclear. Higher tax rate could be due to size of unit, or overall high tax rate for that area", "Higher ratio is more likely in poorly-funded districts, which tend to have higher crime", "Surprising that neighbourhoods with higher-valued homes had more crime")
kable(cbind(m2coef, m2e), format = "latex", booktabs = T, col.names = c("Coefficient", "Possible Reasoning")) %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = c("striped"), full_width = T) %>%
  column_spec(3, width = "30em")
```

This model has an AIC of `r round(model2$aic, 2)`, and a BIC of `r round(BIC(model2), 2)`.

With a Null deviance of `r round(model2$null.deviance, 2)`, and a Residual deviance of `r round(model2$deviance, 2)`, we get a difference of `r round(model2$null.deviance - model2$deviance, 2)`.

Once again, we'll run an ANOVA Chi-Square test on this model.

```{r model-two-anova}
anova(model2, test = "Chisq")
```

This model has a smaller difference between deviances, but has a slightly lower AIC.

## 3.3 Model 3
For the last model, we'll transform `zn` to a binary variable.

```{r transform-zn, cache = T}
crime.training.copy <- crime.training[, -c(2, 3, 5, 11)]
crime.training.copy$zn <- ifelse(crime.training.copy$zn == "0", 0, 1) %>%
  as.factor()
```

```{r model-three, cache = T}
model3 <- glm(formula = target ~ .,
              family = binomial(link = "logit"),
              data = crime.training.copy)
summary(model3)
```

## 3.4 Comparison of Models
```{r models-anova}
anova(model1, model2, model3, test = "Chisq")
```
The anova test tells us that there's good reason to use model two instead of the others.

Interestingly, the third model is slightly worse than the second, even with the modified variables. Since model two has a higher difference between deviances, as well as lower AIC and BIC scores, I'll be using it as my prediction model.

To aid in model selection, I'll split training data into two partitions, use all three models to make predictions, and evaluate each based on several criteria.

```{r split-data}
crime.split <- createDataPartition(y = crime.training$target, p = 0.7, list = F)

ntrain1 <- crime.training[crime.split]
ntest1 <- crime.training[-crime.split]
```

```{r test-model-one}
tm1 <- glm(target ~ .,
           family = binomial(link = "logit"),
           data = ntrain1)

tm1_p <- predict(object = tm1, newdata = ntest1, type = "response")
tm1_p <- ifelse(tm1_p > 0.5,1,0)
```
